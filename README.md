This README provides an overview of a simple chat server written in Java. The server and client sockets are used to facilitate real-time chat interactions. This server allows users to join a chat, send and receive messages, and provides a basic framework for handling multiple users using multi-threading.

## Features

- **Real-time Chat:** Users can send and receive messages in real-time, simulating a chat environment.

- **Username Collection:** The server collects usernames from clients, allowing users to identify each other.

- **Multi-Threading:** The server uses multi-threading to handle multiple clients simultaneously, ensuring smooth chat interactions.

## Technologies Used

**Prerequisites**:

You should have any IDE of you choice installed, I used IntelliJ.

Start the **Backend**:

Then, run Client.class' main to connect with the server (just make sure you are connected to the right InetAdress and port).

Once connected, you can enter your username and start chatting with other users.
